# Netflix_movies_and_tv_shows_clustering

Objective: The objective of this project is to apply machine learning clustering techniques to the Netflix Movies and Shows dataset in order to group similar movies and TV shows together. By doing so, we aim to uncover patterns and similarities among the content available on Netflix, which can help in content recommendation systems and content categorization.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is sourced from Netflix and contains information about various movies and TV shows available on the platform. The dataset includes features such as title, director, cast, description, genre, release year, country, and ratings.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values: Check for and handle missing values in the dataset. Feature selection: Decide which features are relevant for clustering (e.g., genre, release year, country, etc.). Feature engineering: Convert categorical features into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) and normalize numerical features.

Dimensionality Reduction (Optional):

If the dataset has a large number of features, perform dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the feature space and improve clustering performance.

Clustering Algorithm Selection:

Select appropriate clustering algorithms for the task. Common choices include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

Clustering:

Apply the chosen clustering algorithm(s) to the preprocessed dataset to group similar movies and TV shows together. Experiment with different values of hyperparameters (e.g., number of clusters for K-Means) and evaluate the results using internal clustering metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin index, etc.

Interpretation and Visualization:

Visualize the clustered data to gain insights into the grouping patterns and identify any interesting clusters. Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and give meaningful names to the clusters if possible.

Evaluation:

Assess the quality of the clustering results. This can be done through visual inspection and, if available, by comparing the clusters with existing metadata (e.g., genre, release year, etc.). If ground truth labels are available, external evaluation metrics like Adjusted Rand Index or Normalized Mutual Information can be used.

Recommendations:

Based on the clustering results, build a content recommendation system that suggests similar movies or TV shows to users based on their viewing history or preferences.
